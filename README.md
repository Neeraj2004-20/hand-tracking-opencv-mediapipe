 🖐️ Hand Gesture Detection using OpenCV & MediaPipe

This project demonstrates **real-time hand detection and tracking** using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** in Python.  
It detects multiple hands, tracks landmarks, and displays useful visual feedback such as fingertip positions, handedness (Left/Right), and FPS.

- 🔹 Real-time hand tracking using webcam  
- 🔹 Detects up to **2 hands simultaneously**  
- 🔹 Displays:
  - Hand landmarks and connections
  - Handedness (Left or Right hand)
  - Index finger tip position (highlighted with a circle)
  - Real-time FPS counter
- 🔹 Uses **MediaPipe Hands** for highly accurate tracking
